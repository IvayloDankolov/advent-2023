# Advent of code 2023 

I was looking for an excuse to learn Rust. Advenc of Code exists. It was rather simple putting two and two together, really.

That's all this project is. A simple CLI run harness plus the solutions for each day.

I know I'm a bit late to the party. We'll see how many of these we get through, only now getting free time to look at these around the holidays.


## Fun moments

### Day 3

I confess, I fell to temptation and went all "eh, I can't be bothered to parse this nicely. For loops to the rescue #yolo"
I then had to spend an embarassing amount of time debugging a subtle off by one error

Then I wrote the solution to part 2 as a declarative one liner in about 90 seconds and it worked first time.
If that's not a parable to not fall to the tempations of iterative programming and stick to functional purity, I don't know what is.
