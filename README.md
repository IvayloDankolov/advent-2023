# Advent of code 2023 

I was looking for an excuse to learn Rust. Advenc of Code exists. It was rather simple putting two and two together, really.

That's all this project is. A simple CLI run harness plus the solutions for each day.

I know I'm a bit late to the party. We'll see how many of these we get through, only now getting free time to look at these around the holidays.
